# .github/codeql/codeql-config.yml
# Example configuration file for CodeQL JavaScript analysis.
# Note: Debug logging verbosity is set in the workflow file's 'init' step.

name: "Debug JS CodeQL Configuration"

# You can explicitly define query suites here.
# If omitted, the 'init' action often defaults to 'security-extended'.
# Using 'security-and-quality' includes more checks, which might be useful during debugging.
queries:
  - uses: security-and-quality # Includes security-extended plus maintainability/reliability

# Use 'paths' to explicitly include directories if CodeQL isn't finding expected code.
# paths:
#   - src
#   - lib

# Use 'paths-ignore' to exclude specific files/directories.
# This can sometimes help isolate issues or speed up debugging scans.
paths-ignore:
  - '**/node_modules/**'
  - '**/*.min.js'
  - '**/dist/**'
  - '**/build/**'
  - '**/coverage/**'
  - '**/*.test.js'
  - '**/*.spec.js'
  - 'vendor/**'

# There are no specific keys *within this config file* to enable debug logging levels
# for the overall CodeQL Action process. That's done in the workflow file.
